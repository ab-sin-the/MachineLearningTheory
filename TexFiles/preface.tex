\chapter*{Preface}

This is the organized course material of CS 7545 Machine Learning Theory from Georgia Institute of Technology. The material is based on the course in Fall 2019. The instructor of this course is professor \href{https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jabernethy9/}{Jacob Abernethy} and the course website can be found via \href{https://mltheory.github.io/CS7545/}{this link}.

This course contains many theoretical aspects of machine learning, including decision making, online learning, boosting, regret minimization, etc. Students will get familiar with the frontiers of theoretical machine learning research after finishing this course. It is a totally theoretical course and no programming will be covered.

CS 7545 is a graduate level course, thus it has several prerequisites. Familiarity with Algorithm analysis, linear algebra, probability and statistics is a must to understand the contents of this course. Convex analysis background \sout{is strongly recommended but not required} is also very important.

Before studying any algorithm and theory, we will first review some math aspects and point out some notations that we will use in this course material. Afterwards, we will talk about convex analysis and deviation bound. Online learning algorithms will be covered next. Finally, we will talk about statistical learning theory. 

Thanks to professor Jacob Abernethy for his instruction.
